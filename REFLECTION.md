\# Reflection



\## Were your predictions right?

My most screen time day prediction was right based on the output. My best focus day prediction was partially right because the data showed focus was high on multiple days.



\## What surprised you?

I expected higher caffeine to always mean higher focus, but the averages were close and sometimes lower caffeine days had better focus.



\## What was tricky or rewarding?

The tricky part was deciding how to measure “caffeine helps focus” without doing complex math. The rewarding part was seeing patterns show up immediately after printing results.



\## How did using your own data change things?

It made the results feel more meaningful because I could connect the numbers to how the week actually felt.
